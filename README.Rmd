# mumhquarterly

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mumhquarterly is to bring together all of the functions required for production of the Medicines Used in Mental Health quarterly Official Statistics publication by the NHSBSA with accompanying documentation and unit tests in line with RAP best practice.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mumhquarterly from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nhsbsa-data-analytics/mumhquarterly")
```

# everything below this is auto generated garbage

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(mumhquarterly)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
